# PortfolioSite Web Application

While not entirely needed if some of the code if modified to not use the backend server, there is also a backend Web Server to handle specific requests in the `PortfolioServer` directory.

This Website is my current Portfolio Website, but will be rewritten with some new found knowledge which I recently obtained, so look out for a new version of this website here soon.
